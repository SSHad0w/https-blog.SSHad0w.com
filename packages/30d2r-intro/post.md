30D2R - Challenge Introduction

Over the last 5 years I've been mostly reading about Cybersecurity, but recently I've made an initiative to practice a new skill for each month in 2020. This promotes me to learn and attempt the basics of each topic, while it prevents me from getting stuck in rabbit holes. 

### How does it work?
Each month I choose a topic I don't know much about and learn the basics of it. This can be via any method, although I typically default to Udemy and Youtube.

At the end of each month I will post on my [Instagram](https://instagram.com/sshad0w__?igshid=13kkbj41mk22n) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Sshad0w__?s=09) the work I've been doing to show what I've been learning about! Feel free to comment on what you think I should study, or which questions you have about what I'm learning!
